### Nano Deep Learning in 7 Sessions

This course was prepared for the Nanohacker community

    $ git clone https://github.com/deepdeepdot/nano-deep-learning.git
    $ cd nano-deep-learning


If you have python 2.7

    $ python -m SimpleHTTPServer


If you have python 3

    $ python -m http.server


### Overview

It requires proficiency in a programming language, say Ruby or Javascript.
Also, it assumes knowledge of basic git commands and github.
We'll cover some computer science topics like trees, functional 
programming using Python, uses of classes.

Prerequisites
* Experience with programming
* Full stack web development

I decided not to recreate slides that have been wonderfully created by other free online courses. And also reuse much of the available online material on the net.
